 # 🥬 Palak Growth Predictor

This project is a machine learning-based predictor that estimates the leaf count (as a proxy for fresh weight) of palak (spinach) based on growth conditions like:

- NPK levels
- Soil moisture
- pH
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Day since planting

## 💡 Features

- Trained using XGBoost with polynomial features and scaled inputs
- Uses February, March field data and research-backed values (Table 1)
- Provides nutrient advice and growth validation
- MERN stack front end (in progress)
